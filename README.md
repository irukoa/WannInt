# WannInt
### Wannier Interpolation

This is a tiny modern Fortran library to provide utilities for [Wannier interpolation](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.75.195121). The library is meant to serve as a building block for codes that compute the resolution of quantum mechanical operators in the Brillouin zone of a crystal.

### Working principle

The [Wannierization](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.84.1419) procedure consists of post-processing the results of a [DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) calculation into Wannier states. These states are defined on real space and provide an obvious basis to express Bloch states in the reciprocal space. Many quantities in solid state physics (Berry curvature, optical responses, transport properties...) are expressed in reciprocal space in terms of the Hamiltonian and Berry connection operators and its derivatives. This library computes, given a matrix representation of the Hamiltonian and Berry connection in real space, $H_{nm}(\textbf{R})$ and $A^j_{nm}(\textbf{R})$ respectively, the matrix representation $H_{nm}(\textbf{k})$ and $A^j_{nm}(\textbf{k})$ and its derivatives in reciprocal space,

$$
H_{nm}^{lp\cdots }(\textbf{k}) = \sum_{\textbf{R}}\left[\left(iR^l\right)\left(iR^p\right)\cdots\right] e^{i\textbf{k}\cdot \textbf{R}}H_{nm}(\textbf{R}),
$$

$$
A_{nm}^{j \ lp\cdots }(\textbf{k}) = \sum_{\textbf{R}}\left[\left(iR^l\right)\left(iR^p\right)\cdots\right] e^{i\textbf{k}\cdot \textbf{R}}A^j_{nm}(\textbf{R}).
$$

The actual quantities $H_{nm}(\textbf{R})$ and $A^j_{nm}(\textbf{R})$ are given as inputs to the API's routines. For tight-binding models these can be given by hand. For real materials, these can be read from a file generated by the [WANNIER90](https://wannier.org/) code, by setting

```
write_tb = .true.
```
in the WANNIER90 file input card.

# Dependencies

This library uses [MAC](https://github.com/irukoa/MAC)'s containers to store the result of the Hamiltonian and Berry connection calculations when derivatives are requested.

# API

The derived type
``` fortran
type, public :: crystal
```
is defined.

## `type(crystal) :: Cr`
### Constructor.

A crystal is initialized by calling (first way)

```fortran
call Cr%construct(name, &
                  direct_lattice_basis, &
                  num_bands, &
                  R_points, &
                  tunnellings, &
                  dipoles, &
                  fermi_energy)
```
or (second way)
```fortran
call Cr%construct(name, &
                  from_file, &
                  fermi_energy)
```
where

- `character(len=*), intent(in) :: name` is the name of the crystal.
- `real(dp), intent(in) :: direct_lattice_basis(3, 3)` is the basis of the Bravais lattice in $\text{A}$. The first index represents the vector label and the second is the vector component such that `direct_lattice_basis(i, :)` is the Bravais lattice vector $\textbf{a}_i$.
- `integer, intent(in) :: num_bands` is the number of bands in the crystalline system.
- `integer, intent(in) :: R_points(num_r_points, 3)` represents the set of direct lattice points to be included in the sums $\sum_{\textbf{R}}$ in terms of the Bravais lattice basis vectors. `R_points(i, :)` is identified with the integers $(c^i_1, c^i_2, c^i_3)$ such that

$$
\textbf{R} = c^i_1\textbf{a}_1 + c^i_2\textbf{a}_2 + c^i_3\textbf{a}_3
$$

- `complex(dp), intent(in) :: tunnellings(num_r_points, num_bands, num_bands)` represents the Hamiltonian operator's matrix elements $H_{nm}(\textbf{R})$ in $\text{eV}$. The first index identifies $\textbf{R}$ and the second and third $n, m$, respectively.
- `complex(dp), intent(in) :: dipoles(num_r_points, num_bands, num_bands, 3)` represents the Berry connection's matrix elements $A^j_{nm}(\textbf{R})$ in $\text{A}$. The first index identifies $\textbf{R}$, the second and third $n, m$, respectively and the forth the cartesian component $j$.
- `real(dp), optional, intent(in) :: fermi_energy` represents the crystal's Fermi energy in $\text{eV}$.
- `character(len=*), intent(in) :: from_file` is the path of a WANNIER90 format tight-binding file, relative to the program's execution directory. The Bravais lattice basis, the number of bands, the number of Bravais lattice points, their coordinates and the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and Berry connection will be read from file.

## Diagonalization utility.

The library includes a wrapper of `dsyev` and `zheev` routines from LAPACK. It can be called by

```fortran
call diagonalize(matrix, P [, D, eig])
